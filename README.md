# Ovarian Cancer Detection Using CNN and Medical Imaging

This project implements an automated ovarian cancer detection system using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CT scan medical images.

## Overview
- Binary and stage-wise ovarian cancer classification
- ResNet-50 with transfer learning
- Medical image preprocessing (DICOM)
- Explainable AI using Grad-CAM

## Dataset
- TCGA-OV (The Cancer Genome Atlas – Ovarian Cancer)
- Dataset link:(https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/tcga-ov/)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN (ResNet-50)
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Medical Imaging

## Results
The model achieved strong performance in detecting ovarian cancer and
demonstrates the potential of deep learning in healthcare diagnostics.
